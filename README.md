- 👋 Hi, I’m @mikeliucc
- 👀 I’m interested in all-things-automation, particularly in Test Automation and Business Process Automation (BPA).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to improve Nexial's capability and usability to be a more viable option for the general populous, especially those who are not professional programmers.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on improving automation project management, test report, selenium, appium, API testing, automating exploratory testing
- 📫 How to reach me via https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-liu-421b2856 or via nexiality.slack.com (looking for @automike)
